## About the project

This is my second project for the Software Engineering Immersive course at General Assembly. The main requirement was to build a full-stack CRUD application that interacts with a database.

I set out to build an app that can store loose recipes in a single place, and just show the recipe information. This keeps them all in one place, just like your nanna's good old-fashioned recipe box.

## Languages and technologies used

HTML, python, CSS, SQL
Flask, postgress

## Installation instructions

Install a python virtual environment (python3 -m venv venv)
Activate the virtual environment (source venv/bin/activate)
Install packages (pip install requirements.txt)
Run the app (python3 app.py)

## Future goals

- Bookmark recipes other users have added
- Search function to add in a handful of ingredients in your pantry, and returns possible recipes you could make
- Edit recipes
- Ability to adjust the quantity of the ingredients you use (for example, make half, double)
